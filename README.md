# PHP Assignment Repository

Welcome to my PHP Assignment repository! Here, I showcase my PHP code for various exercises and in-class tasks. This repository contains practical examples, covering different aspects of PHP programming.

## Projects

### [Exercise 3: Variable & Operators (variable.php)](./variable.php)

This project focuses on creating a simple HTML form to get the user's Firstname and Lastname, printing it out using the echo statement. Additionally, it includes tasks related to preparing a simple HTML table and writing PHP scripts for string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and browser detection.

In this exercise, I demonstrate the use of control flow structures in PHP. The code involves logical conditions and loops to control the flow of execution.
